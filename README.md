# Flappy
Description:
Flappy Bird is a popular 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird that needs to navigate through a series of pipes. The goal is to fly as far as possible without colliding with any obstacles.

Gameplay:

The game starts with the bird positioned in the middle of the screen, and a series of pipes appear from the right side of the screen.
The player can control the bird using the keyboard. For example, pressing the spacebar will make the bird flap its wings, causing it to ascend momentarily.
The bird descends automatically due to gravity, and the player's task is to time their flaps correctly to pass through the gaps between the pipes.
If the bird collides with the ground or any of the pipes, the game ends and the player's score is displayed.
The score is calculated based on the number of pipes the bird successfully passes through.
The player can choose to play again after the game ends.
